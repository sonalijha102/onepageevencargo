                <p>Mobility is not just about movement—it is about access to opportunities, independence, and
                    empowerment. For women across India, mobility challenges often act as a barrier to education,
                    employment, and social participation. Women Mobility Centers (WMCs) are innovative, inclusive spaces
                    designed to bridge this gap by enabling, enhancing, and empowering women's mobility—especially for
                    those from underserved or marginalized backgrounds.</p>

                <p>A Women Mobility Center is a dedicated facility or ecosystem that supports women in
                    acquiring, enhancing, and utilizing mobility skills. These centers provide training,
                    resources, and employment linkages focused on non-traditional sectors like professional
                    driving, delivery services, transport services, and vehicle maintenance.
                    WMCs serve as skill-building, support, and empowerment hubs that aim to break gender
                    stereotypes in the mobility and logistics sector</p>

                    also challenge gender stereotypes in the logistics and transport sectors. By fostering skill 
                    development and creating sustainable career pathways, Even Cargo is driving a more inclusive and 
                    equitable workforce, paving the way for a future where women have equal access to mobility and
